# Ludo

## Description Of The App

Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens
from start to finish according to the rolls of a dice. This app is an emulation of the real board game, it purpose is to give the user the same 
experience and satisfaction a real ludo board would. 


## Approach Taken
First of all I created the board structure of the game. I created a pahtway where each token's would follow and I used div's to create each pathway giving each of them an id starting from 0 all the way to 71.
I used div to represent each tokens in each color and game them classes of different names.

## Technologies Used

I made use of HTML DIVs, button and the regular p and h1 tags
Made use of CSS, I got to play with flex and grid a lot since I had more than 71 divs to align
Lastly I made use of Javascript. EventListener pissed me off cause I didn't know if I could pause it or not,
but I think I bullied it instead, made use of the regular loops and conditional statements, also functions

## Post-project Reflection

It was a fun experience, I feel I didn't give my MVP enough attention at first cause I was so eager to start the project,
but lesson learnt, one needs to plan first before embarking on such adventures. also got to learn new error statements and also 
the importance of console.log when debugging. can't wait to learn new things and come back to edit this piece
